# two-dc-motor-with-encoder-in-arduino-mega

Prerequistie:
Install the MDDS30 library in the "Arduino/Libraries" folder


 final code for velocity control: ros_dc_encoder_cytron_driver_1_with_encoder_both_side
 
 
 final code for position control: ros_dc_encoder_cytron_driver_1_with_encoder_rough_position_cont
 
 
 actually it worked good only but had few minor issues and the board crashed before the final test and then we moved to rpi
